\section*{About this project}
This project provides access to the system \texttt{LatexMk} initialization (configuration) file used by Overleaf.  \texttt{LatexMk} is a Perl script which may vary slightly according to the \TeX{} Live version and compiler chosen for the project. If you need to be 100\% certain which  \texttt{LatexMk} is being used, add code from this project to your project and compile to typeset a listing of \texttt{LatexMk} and make it available for download as one of the output files.
